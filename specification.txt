RGB image compression.

MAIN_IMAGE
	consists of:
	- VARINT width minus 1
	- VARINT height minus 1
	- IMAGE

	its RANGE is 256

IMAGE:

	An IMAGE consists of:
	- METHOD
	- TRANSFORM_DATA
	- IMAGE_DATA

	To decode an IMAGE, its width, height and RANGE are also required.

METHOD:
	- BYTE
	where the bits have the following meanings (most significant bit first)
	- bit 0:
		RESERVED, may be used for a TILE_TRANSFORM in the future
	- bit 1:
		RESERVED, may be used for PROGRESSIVE in the future
	- bit 2:
		0 means greyscale, only one channel is coded, with the other two equal to the first.
		1 means colour
	- bit 3:
		INDEX_TRANSFORM is used
	- bit 4:
		COLOUR_TRANSFORM is used
	- bit 5:
		PREDICTION_TRANSFORM is used
	- bit 6:
		ENTROPY_CODING is used
	- bit 7:
		LZ is used

VARINT:
	encodes a 28bit number.
	the most significant bit is not counted, and if it is set indicates that another byte should be read.
	the first byte contains the 7 least significant digits of the 28bit number, the second the next seven, and so on.
	a varint may not have more than 4 bytes, and the most significant bit of the last byte should not be set.

TRANSFORM_DATA:
	contains the following data in order, if their respective METHOD bits are set
	- (conditional) INDEX_TRANSFORM_DATA
	- (conditional) COLOUR_TRANSFORM_DATA
	- (conditional) PREDICTION_TRANSFORM_DATA
	- (conditional) ENTROPY_CODING_DATA
	- (conditional) LZ_DATA

INDEX_TRANSFORM_DATA:
	- BYTE: indicating the width  of the INDEX_IMAGE minus 1
	- BYTE: indicating the height of the INDEX_IMAGE minus 1
	- INDEX_IMAGE
	- (conditional) VARINT: index_index_image width  minus 1
	- (conditional) VARINT: index_index_image height minus 1
	- (conditional) INDEX_INDEX_IMAGE

INDEX_IMAGE:
	- IMAGE
	each row represent an INDEX.
	if a pixel is repeated in an INDEX, the INDEX is terminated, and the repeated pixel and the remaining pixels of the row are coded, but have no meaning for the INDEX.

INDEX:
	a list of pixel values, at most 256 entries long.
	

INDEX_INDEX_IMAGE:
	if the height of the INDEX_IMAGE is greater than 1, a second image divides the parent IMAGE into blocks to indicate which INDEX is used where


COLOUR_TRANSFORM_DATA:
	- VARINT: COLOUR_TRANSFORM_IMAGE width  minus 1
	- VARINT: COLOUR_TRANSFORM_IMAGE height minus 1
	- COLOUR_TRANSFORM_IMAGE
	
COLOUR_TRANSFORM_IMAGE:
	- IMAGE
	where each pixel has the GREEN_TO_RED, GREEN_TO_BLUE and RED_TO_BLUE transform values in a RANGE of 256 to be used for eah block

PREDICTION_TRANSFORM_DATA:
	- BYTE: number of predictors to use minus 1
	- (1-256) PREDICTOR
	- (conditional) VARINT: predictor_image width  minus 1
	- (conditional) VARINT: predictor_image height minus 1
	- (conditional) PREDICTOR_IMAGE


PREDICTOR:
	- BYTE: a, b
	- BYTE: c, d

ENTROPY_CODING_DATA:
	- BYTE: number of entropy tables minus 1
	- ENTROPY_TABLE_LIST
	- (conditional) VARINT: entropy_image width  minus 1
	- (conditional) VARINT: entropy_image height minus 1
	- (conditional) ENTROPY_IMAGE

LZ_DATA
	- LZ_TABLE_LIST
