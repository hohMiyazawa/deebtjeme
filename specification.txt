This is an experiment in lossless image compression.

No attempt is made to made a fully featured image format. If this scheme is to have a real world application, it should be embedded in some suitable container format.

Part 1: Minimal container format for standalone files.

Consists of:

WIDTH
HEIGHT
PIXEL FORMAT

Width and height are both encoded as varints, minus one.

The pixel format is a byte with the following bits:

0DDDDDAC

bit 0: a "0", reserved for future extension of the header format.
	If this is set to "1", the bitstream does not conform to this standard.
bit 1-5: bit depth, minus one. Values in the range 1-32
bit 6: signals if an alpha channel is present
bit 7: signals if colour is present

for this purpose, the values of bits 6 and 7 have the following meanings:

00: greyscale
01: RGB
10: greyscale + alpha
11: ARGB

The size of this header is thus 3-9 bytes

Part 2: Compression format

Consists of:

TRANSFORMS
DATA FOR TRANSFORMS
IMAGE DATA

TRANSFORMS consists of one byte with the following bits:

bit 0: reserved, should be 0
bit 1: signals if the SYMMETRY transform is used
bit 2: signals if the SUB_GREEN transform is used
bit 3: signals if the INDEX transform is used
bit 4: signals if the PREDICTION transform is used
bit 5: signals if the ENTROPY_MAP transform is used
bit 6: signals if the LZ transform is used
bit 7; signals if the image data is entropy coded

Remark: some combinations are not valid:
if entropy coding is not used, PREDICTION and ENTROPY_MAP should be set to zero.
